    "We can first consider the grid as a matrix, each element in the matrix represents the number of routes to that a location in the grid. For example, for a 2×2 grid, the dimension of the matirx is 3 by 3 and matrix[2][2] = 6, meaning that there are 6 routes to the bottom right corner. Similarly, we can calculate that For the other location, The question requires us to calculate the routes through the 20×20 grid, we can first set the boundary condition, that is, for those location on the top or left boundary of the grid, there is only one route to that location. And for all the other locations, the number of routes equal to the number of routes on its left plus the number of routes on this top, so we can see this problem as a dynamic programming. "
